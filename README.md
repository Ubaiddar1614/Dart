# 🚀 Working on Dart

Welcome to my Dart learning repository!

This repo is a collection of everything I'm learning and building with the Dart programming language. It includes hands-on exercises, mini-projects, and concept demonstrations to help me grow as a developer.

## 📂 What's Inside

### 🔧 Core Concepts
- **Functions**: Examples and exercises using Dart functions — from basics to parameter tricks.
- **Collections**: Dart Lists, Sets, Maps in action.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, and polymorphism — all coded out.
- **Data Structures & Algorithms**: DSA implementations in Dart, from arrays to recursion.

### 🔁 Work In Progress
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Futures, async/await, and handling delays — coming soon.
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks, custom exceptions, and proper Dart error management — also coming soon.

### 🧪 Mini Projects
- CLI-based student registration app and more — using dart:io, lists, maps, OOP, and functions together.
